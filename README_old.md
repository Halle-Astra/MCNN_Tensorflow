# Single Image crowd counting using Multi-Column CNN.
This is unofficial and very simple implementation of the CVPR 2016 paper on crowd counting "Single-image crowd counting via multi-column convolutional neural network".
Full code is developed on Tensorflow platform. 

## Installation
1) Install Tensorflow
2) Clone this repository
  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/aditya-vora/crowd_counting_tensorflow.git
  ```
3) Download the dataset and keep it in the $ROOT/data folder
4) The dataset can be downloaded from: 

    Dropbox:   https://www.dropbox.com/s/fipgjqxl7uj8hd5/ShanghaiTech.zip?dl=0
    
    Baidu Disk: http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nuAYslz
5) Train the model using $ROOT/train.py
6) Test the model

**Note:** More details about the results and some other code files for data parsing will be updated soon.
